# Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

* [All pairs shortest path problem](https://github.com/LSijing/Algorithms-Stanford/edit/master/c4-shortest-path-NPcomplete/all_shortest_path.py)<br>
Including Floyd-Warshall algorithm, Johnson's algorithm, using Bellman-Ford for detecting negative cycle, 
and [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://github.com/LSijing/Algorithms-Stanford/edit/master/c4-shortest-path-NPcomplete/dijkstra.py) for all single source shortest paths as part of Johnson's algorithm.

* [Traveling salesman problem](https://github.com/LSijing/Algorithms-Stanford/edit/master/c4-shortest-path-NPcomplete/tsp.py)<br>
Including an exact dynamic programming algorithm and an approximate greedy algorithm.

* [2-satisfiability problem](https://github.com/LSijing/Algorithms-Stanford/edit/master/c4-shortest-path-NPcomplete/2SAT.py)<br>
Using SCC.
